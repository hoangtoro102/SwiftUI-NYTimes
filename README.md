# SwiftUI-NYTimes
This SwiftUI iOS app uses Combine and MVVM architecture to interact with the New York Times API. With a clean architecture, it has 3 screens: Home with Most Viewed articles, Search for articles by keywords, and List for article details. Best practices for SwiftUI and Combine make it a great starter project.
